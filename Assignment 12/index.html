            <h2>The Constellation Program (2004-2010) was the intended replacement for the Space Shuttle program following its scheduled retirement in 2011.</h2>
            <h2>The stated goals were ambitious with the completion of the International Space Station (ISS) (and continued support), a manned Moon landing, and manned Mars mission. The manned Moon landings were to be completed before 2020, with plans of manned Mars missions being scheduled for the late 2030s. </h2>
            <h2>The cost was large, just under a quarter trillion dollars over a period of 21 years (which would be around 11 billion dollars a year), and by 2009 the cracks had already started to appear. The <a style = "text-decoration: underline" onClick = 'window.open("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Review_of_United_States_Human_Space_Flight_Plans_Committee")'>Augustine Committee</a> under Barack Obama evaluated the program and found it was not only behind schedule, but it was also underfunded as well as overbudget. This eventually lead to the program being scrapped and components being scavenged for uses in other programs.</h2>
            <h2>The results of this can be seen in the Orion capsule recently launched on the Space Launch System (SLS), which was intended to ferry astronauts to the ISS and also take them to the Moon. Ironically, the SLS is also a combination of not only components from the Space Shuttle program (engines and solid boosters) but also the Ares rockets for the Constellation program.</h2>
            <h2>The reasons behind the program's cancellation are many and varied, with there by a good deal of speculation on the "real" reasons why it was cancelled. The 2008 financial crisis was nearing its end by the start of 2009 and a money-pit NASA project was likely one of the first places budget cuts could be made to try and reduce the federal deficit. Couple this with NASA being underfunded for the goals they were tasked with achieving, as well as having to develop novel technologies, and this was a recipe for failure.</h2>
            <h2>This ends up causing the issue of NASA trying to undersell the actual cost of the program, as well as the timeframe feasibility, in order to actually get funding for a project. It was often the case that projects that overblew their initial budget and timeframe, but ended up delivering in the end (if the delivery was notable enough), would continue to be funded until completion and most would forget about the budgetary and timeframe failings. When unforeseen technical issues appeared, it's difficult to solve them if you don't have the appropriate budget to hire engineers or get adequate testing, this was especially true for NASA whose budget was incredibly subject to the whims of Congress.</h2>
            <h2>NASA has only ever received their requested budget 7 times throughout their over 60 year history, meaning that often they need to undersell costs and oversell what they can deliver on in that timeframe in order to get even a fraction of an adequate budget.</h2>
            <h2>These issues are further compounded by the price-gouging that NASA deals with from private contractors (which is present in all private contracts that the federal government awards, especially those that supply the Department of Defense), this can balloon the costs a hundred-fold simply for the reason that NASA cannot use other manufacturers to acquire parts nor make it themselves. Coupled with the actual contracts to build these systems being through companies like Boeing, Lockheed, SpaceX, etc., NASA retains no actual personnel nor engineers that have experience making these systems and can teach new employees. Those who actually do have said experience/knowledge are pouched by these companies from NASA with promise of better wages that NASA can't match (due to the constantly limited budget)</h2><br>
            <h2>While not exactly the reasons why, these are just a couple of the primary reasons behind the many issues at NASA and the associated Constellation program.</h2><br>
