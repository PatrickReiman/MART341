            <h2>The Constellation Program (2004-2010) was the intended replacement for the Space Shuttle program following its scheduled retirement in 2011.</h2>
            <h2>The stated goals were ambitious with the completion of the International Space Station (ISS) (and continued support), a manned Moon landing, and manned Mars mission. The manned Moon landings were to be completed before 2020, with plans of manned Mars missions being scheduled for the late 2030s. </h2>
            <h2>The cost was large, just under a quarter trillion dollars over a period of 21 years (which would be around 11 billion dollars a year), and by 2009 the cracks had already started to appear. The <a style = "text-decoration: underline" onClick = 'window.open("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Review_of_United_States_Human_Space_Flight_Plans_Committee")'>Augustine Committee</a> under Barack Obama evaluated the program and found it was not only behind schedule, but it was also underfunded as well as overbudget. This eventually lead to the program being scrapped and components being scavenged for uses in other programs.</h2>
