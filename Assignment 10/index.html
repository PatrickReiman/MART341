                    <p>The INTELSAT VI (F-3) satellite, stranded in an unusable orbit since its launch aboard a Titan vehicle in March 1990, was captured by crew members during an EVA and equipped with a new perigee kick motor. The satellite was subsequently released into orbit and the new motor fired to put the spacecraft into a geosynchronous orbit for operational use.</p>

                    <p>Shortly after its 1990 deployment, NASA discovered a flaw in the observatory's primary mirror that affected the clarity of the telescope's early images. Fortunately, Hubble's design allowed astronauts to perform repairs, replace parts, and update its technology with new instruments while in orbit. Servicing Mission 1 was the first opportunity to install corrective optics that counteracted the primary mirror's flaw, add new instruments, and conduct planned maintenance on the telescope.</p>
