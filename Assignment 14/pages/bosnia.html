This was during the height of the Bosnian War in which Sarajevo was besieged (on almost all sides) by Bosnian Serbs and Yugoslavian remnants. The UNPROFOR was a United Nations taskforce that was deployed during the conflict to conduct humanitarian and peacekeeping operations. Their role in Sarajevo was to protect the Sarajevo International Airport that was a vital supply line, as well as aid civilians in the besieged city.</h1>
